## Introduction
- (2022-5-24): We provide a [toolbox](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/LLVIP/blob/main/toolbox/toolbox_readme.md) for various format conversions (xml to yolov5, xml to yolov3, xml to coco)
- (2022-3-27): We released some raw data (unregistered image pairs and videos) for further research including image registration. Please visit [homepage](https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/LLVIP/) to get the update. (2022-3-28 We have updated the link of Baidu Yun of LLVIP raw data, the data downloaded from the new link supports decompression under `windows` and `macos`. The original link only support `windows`.)
- (2021-12-25): We released a Kaggle Community Competition "[Find Person in the Dark!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/find-person-in-the-dark)" based on part of LLVIP dataset. Welcome playing and having fun! Attention: only the visible-image data we uploaded in Kaggle platform is allowed to use (the infrared images in LLVIP or other external data are forbidden)
- (2021-11-24): Pedestrian detection models were released
- (2021-09-01): We have released the dataset, please visit [homepage](https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/LLVIP/) to get the dataset. (Note that we removed some low-quality images from the original dataset, and for this version there are 30976 images.)
